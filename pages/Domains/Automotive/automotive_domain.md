    desc: Lidar and Camera, the most used sensors in the car have limitations in adverse weather conditions â€“ rain, snow and fog and low light conditions. With this knowledge of visual common-sense, the vehicle control module can be improved to an extent where an end-user should be able to instruct an autonomous car to do certain actions wrt driving.
