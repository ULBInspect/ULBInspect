title: Applying Graph neural networks for medical image analysis 
subtitle: 
---

### Project Motivation
GNNs can learn spectral and spatial features from the data, they have less trainable parameters and thus possibly are more explainable.  

#### Project Description
Graphs are abstract data structure comprising of nodes and edges, where edges denote the relationship between nodes. Graphs has more expressive power as they can be used as denotation of large systems like social networks, protein-protein interactions and much more. Graph neural networks are models that tries to harness the power of graph structure, they try to learn more latent embedded information in the non-Euclidean space. In graphs nodes can be heterogenous in nature, our primary objective is to produce an efficient model that could works consistently and accurately on various modalities in medical imaging like MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), CT (Computed Tomography), X-RAY etc.
